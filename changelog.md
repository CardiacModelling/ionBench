# Changelog

## v0.2-alpha
Planned changes:
* New SPSA algorithm
* Local optimality performance metric and derivative calculator
* More optimisers

## v0.1.1-alpha - Current release
Added unit tests and removed old test scripts. Approaches have been relabelled to modifications. A derivative calculator has been implemented but will still see more work before it can be used by the optimisers.

## v0.1.0-alpha
Initial release. Contains two staircase problems, two problems from Loewe et al and a problem from Moreno et al. Includes approaches, uncertainty quantification, and optimisers from pints, scipy, spsa and a collection of 5 published algorithms

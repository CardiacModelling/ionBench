# Find the curved line between the steepest direction and the minimum is a quadratic shape is assumed based on the local curvature. Minimise along this line using Brent's method, as implemented in Press et al. "Numerical Recipes in C" by scipy. Update from Dokos 2004 compared with Dokos 2003 says that if you reach a local minimum whose cost is non-zero, you should weight the residuals and carry on

    """
    Curvilinear gradient descent from Dokos 2004. This method was first introduced in Dokos 2003, with this implementation using the updated scheme which includes weighted residuals (Dokos 2004). It calculates a curved path which initially follows the steepest descent, but curves to finally converge towards a Gauss-Newton step (minimum of a locally defined quadratic). In order to optimise along this line, we use Scipy's implementation of Brent's method (an implementation based on Press et al. "Numerical Recipes in C").

    Parameters
    ----------
    bm : Benchmarker
        A benchmarker to evaluate the performance of the optimisation algorithm.
    x0 : list, optional
        Initial parameter guess. If x0=None (the default), then the population will be sampled from the benchmarker problems .sample() method.
    maxIter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations of curvilinear gradient descent, summed up over all reweighting restarts. The default is 1000.
    maxInnerIter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations of curvilinear gradient descent before reweighting. The default is 100.
    costThreshold : float, optional
        The maximum acceptable weighted cost. Optimisation terminates only once this threshold is reached, or maxIter is exceeded. Default is 0.
    debug : bool, optional
        If True, debug information will be printed, reporting that status of the optimisation each generation. The default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    xbest : list
        The best parameters identified.
